# Topix

## Project Description

The idea of my project is to create a tool for convenient movie selection for the evening. This tool will consist of a database of approximately 100 films and an application written in PyQt.

Users will access the application and select films based on various criteria such as genre, release year, duration, director, and country. The application will use these criteria to suggest several films that match the user's request.

## Objectives Solved by the Project

The project helps users quickly and easily choose a movie for the evening that matches their interests.

## Detailed Information

### Database

The database will contain information based on the following film criteria:
- Title
- Genre
- Release Year
- Duration
- Director
- Country

### Application

The application will have a simple and intuitive interface. Users will be able to select films using various filters, such as:
- Genre
- Release Year
- Duration
- Director
- Country

The application will use machine learning algorithms to select films that match the user's request.

### Project Advantages
